## Security Overview

Learn how to protect your Analog Labs account and products.

### Best Practices

- Keep your Human Verification Cards in a secure location.
- Never share your scratch-off codes until you are verifying a caller.
- Replace your card immediately if a code becomes visible or compromised.

### Reporting Issues

If you suspect any security problem with our products or website,
please contact us at [security@analog-labs.com](mailto:security@analog-labs.com).
We take all reports seriously and will work quickly to address them.

### Common Threats

- **Phishing attempts**: attackers may pose as Analog Labs to steal your credentials.
- **Physical tampering**: keep your cards safe from unauthorized access.
- **Software vulnerabilities**: always keep your operating system and browser up to date.
### Verifying a Caller

Ask the caller to read the code from their card. If it matches one of your unused codes, you can trust the caller. If they hesitate or give a wrong code, end the call.
