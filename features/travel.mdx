## Travel Page Documentation

### Coordinating Everyone's Journey

The Travel page is your coordination center for getting everyone to your event and back home again. It goes beyond simple flight tracking—it's a comprehensive logistics hub that manages every aspect of transportation and accommodation, from initial travel planning through real-time arrival updates and ground transport coordination.

### What the Travel Page Does

Think of the Travel page as your event's transportation command center. It connects the dots between flights, hotels, ground transportation, and schedule items to ensure everyone arrives when and where they need to be.

The page serves several critical functions:

- **Transportation Tracking:** Monitor flights, trains, cars, and other travel methods
- **Accommodation Management:** Track hotel check-ins, room assignments, and special needs
- **Coordination Hub:** Connect travel with pickup arrangements and schedule items
- **Real-Time Manifests:** See who's arriving when and track their journey status
- **Itinerary Generation:** Create personalized travel documents for individuals or comprehensive manifests for teams
- **Status Monitoring:** Track booking confirmations, delays, and arrival updates

### Understanding Travel Views

#### Multiple Perspectives for Different Needs

The Travel page offers three distinct views, each optimized for different aspects of travel management:
- **Manifest View** presents a comprehensive table of everyone's travel arrangements. See names, travel types, routes, timing, and status all in one organized display. This view excels during busy arrival periods when you need to track multiple people and coordinate pickups.
- **Itinerary View** focuses on individual travelers, showing their complete journey timeline including flights, ground transportation, accommodation, and any related schedule items. This personal approach is perfect for concierge-style service or when helping someone understand their full travel experience.
- **Calendar View** plots travel against dates, ideal for managing group movements and understanding arrival patterns. See when your busiest arrival days will be and plan accordingly.

### Creating Travel Entries

#### Building Complete Travel Records

When you add travel for someone, you're creating a comprehensive record that goes far beyond basic flight information. Start by selecting the travel type—commercial flights, charter flights, trains, buses, rideshares, personal vehicles, or even accommodation stays.

- **Essential Information:** Capture departure and arrival times with timezone awareness (crucial for events with participants from multiple time zones). Record specific airlines, flight numbers, train services, or transportation companies. Include confirmation numbers and booking references that people will need.
- **Location Details:** Enter departure and arrival locations with support for airport codes, train stations, or specific addresses. The system's geolocation features help ensure accuracy and can integrate with mapping services.
- **Person Connections:** Link travel to one or more people. For group travel, assign multiple participants to the same flight or transportation. Each person can have role-specific notes like "Tour Manager" or "Equipment Handler."

#### Status Tracking Through the Journey

Travel entries progress through logical status stages that reflect real-world transportation workflows:

- **Not Booked:** Initial planning stage
- **Booked:** Reservation made but not confirmed
- **Confirmed:** Travel arrangements locked in
- **Ticketed:** Tickets issued and ready
- **In Transit:** Currently traveling
- **Arrived:** Successfully completed
- **Canceled:** Plans changed or canceled

This progression helps teams understand where each traveler stands in their journey and what actions might be needed.

### Accommodation Management

#### Hotels as Part of the Journey

The Travel page treats lodging as an integral part of travel logistics, not a separate concern. Hotel entries include check-in and check-out dates, room types, confirmation numbers, and special accommodation notes.

- **Integration with Travel:** Link hotel stays to arrival and departure transportation. See someone's complete journey from airport pickup through hotel check-in to event venue arrival.
- **Special Requirements:** Track accessibility needs, room preferences, and any special arrangements in the accommodation record. This information stays connected to the person's profile for consistency across future events.
- **Payment Responsibility:** Track whether accommodations are covered by the organization or paid by the traveler, important for billing and expense management.

### Coordination and Scheduling

#### Connecting Travel to Operations

One of the Travel page's most powerful features is its integration with your event schedule. Connect arrival flights to pickup schedule items, link hotel check-outs to departure coordination, and ensure transportation timing aligns with call times and event schedules.

- **Pickup Coordination:** Mark travel entries as needing ground transportation. Link these to schedule items for driver assignments, meeting points, and timing coordination. The system helps ensure no one gets stranded at the airport.
- **Schedule Integration:** When someone's travel connects to a schedule item, both records show the relationship. Change a flight time, and the system alerts you to update the related pickup schedule.

#### Smart Duplication

When managing group travel, use duplication features to quickly create similar entries for multiple people. Copy a flight itinerary for an entire band, then adjust individual details like seat preferences or special requirements. Batch creation with time offsets helps when groups travel on slightly staggered schedules.

### Real-Time Management

#### During Event Execution

The Travel page transforms into a live coordination center during arrival and departure periods. Track real-time status updates, monitor delays, and coordinate with ground transportation in response to changes.

- **Visual Status Indicators:** Color-coded displays immediately show you who's on schedule, delayed, or experiencing issues. Green for arrived, yellow for in transit, red for problems requiring attention.
- **Mobile Access:** The travel manifest works on phones and tablets, essential when coordinating from airports or venues. Field teams can update statuses and check arrangements on the go.

#### Communication Integration

Connect travel information with communication systems. Send arrival notifications to pickup drivers, alert team members about delays, or automatically notify hotels about late check-ins.

### Finding and Filtering Travel

#### Smart Organization

Use filters to focus on specific aspects of travel management. View only today's arrivals, filter by travel type to see all flights together, or focus on specific individuals or groups.

- **Search Capabilities:** Find travel entries by searching names, flight numbers, airlines, or destinations. The system looks across all travel details to help you locate specific arrangements quickly.
- **Tag Integration:** Apply the same tagging system used elsewhere in the platform to categorize travel. Tag VIP arrivals, group movements, or technical equipment transport for easy identification and reporting.

### Privacy and Access Control

#### Sensitive Information Management

Travel involves personal and potentially sensitive information. The Travel page includes robust privacy controls to protect this data while ensuring operational teams have what they need.

- **Field-Level Privacy:** Mark specific fields like passport numbers or personal contact information as private, visible only to authorized personnel. Operations teams might see flight details while sensitive personal data remains restricted.
- **Visibility Settings:** Control who can see travel information for each person. Some participants might have public arrival times while others require complete privacy.

### Reporting and Communication

#### Professional Itineraries

Generate polished, branded itineraries for individual travelers or comprehensive manifests for operational teams. Include exactly the level of detail needed for each audience—detailed technical information for crew, simplified timing for guests.

- **Flexible Content:** Choose which travel segments to include, what level of detail to show, and whether to include attached documents like boarding passes or hotel confirmations.
- **Distribution Options:** Email itineraries directly to travelers, generate shareable links for easy access, or export PDFs for printing and offline reference.

#### Manifest Management

Create operational manifests that help teams coordinate arrivals, manage transportation, and track everyone throughout the travel process. Filter by arrival dates, group by travel type, or focus on specific logistical needs.

### Integration Across the Platform

#### Connected Information

Travel doesn't exist in isolation—it connects to people's profiles, schedule items, and related files. See someone's travel preferences from their People profile, attach boarding passes or travel documents as files, and link travel to schedule items for seamless coordination.

- **Preference Integration:** Pull travel preferences from People profiles to inform booking decisions. Someone's preference for aisle seats or specific airlines helps ensure comfortable travel experiences.

### Import and Export

- **Bulk Import:** Upload travel information from spreadsheets using provided templates. Especially useful when working with travel agencies or importing existing booking data.
- **Export Options:** Generate reports for different stakeholders—detailed manifests for operations teams, simplified schedules for executives, or individual itineraries for travelers.

### Best Practices for Travel Success

- **Plan for Delays:** Build buffer time into ground transportation schedules. Flights are often delayed, and having cushion time prevents cascade effects on event schedules.
- **Over-Communicate:** Include detailed pickup instructions, contact information, and contingency plans in travel records. When someone lands in an unfamiliar city, they'll appreciate having everything they need immediately accessible.
- **Track Documentation:** Attach boarding passes, hotel confirmations, and ground transport arrangements to travel entries. Having all documents in one place prevents confusion and provides backup when needed.
- **Monitor Status Actively:** Especially during arrival periods, regularly update travel status and monitor for delays or changes. Real-time information helps teams respond quickly to issues.
- **Connect Everything:** Link travel to schedule items, attach relevant files, and ensure information flows between modules. These connections prevent information silos and help teams understand the full context.
- **Plan for Issues:** Have contingency protocols for common problems like delayed flights, canceled transportation, or accommodation issues. Document these procedures and ensure responsible team members know how to execute them.
- **Respect Privacy:** Be mindful of what travel information needs to be widely accessible versus what should be restricted. Not everyone needs to see passport numbers or personal emergency contacts.
- **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review travel arrangements, especially for large events with complex logistics. Catch conflicts, missing arrangements, or coordination issues before they become problems.

The Travel page transforms what can be a logistical nightmare into a manageable, transparent system. By connecting transportation, accommodation, and coordination into one comprehensive view, it helps ensure everyone arrives where they need to be, when they need to be there, ready to make your event successful.
