## What is a network?

A network is a small group of people who may need to verify each other. If two groups never need to interact—like different sides of your family or your friends versus your family—keep them separate. This keeps each group's codes private.

## Starting a network

1. Gather everyone who needs to verify one another.
2. Create identical cards for all members.
3. Distribute the cards in person or by secure mail.

Keep networks small and only include members who truly need access.

## Managing a network

- **Adding or removing people**: When someone joins or leaves, create a fresh set of identical cards for the entire network and destroy the old ones.
- **Storing cards**: Treat cards like credit cards. Keep them in a safe place or wherever you store other sensitive items.
- **Network size**: Use the principle of least privilege—people who don't need to verify each other should be in their own network.

## Security protocol

- Never share codes online or through chat. Reveal a code only by scratching it during a verification call.
- Share cards only in person or via trusted mail. Avoid any digital exchange of codes or photos.
