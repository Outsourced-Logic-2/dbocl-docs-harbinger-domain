If you receive a call that feels suspicious, use your cards to confirm the caller's identity.

1. Hang up the call.
2. Navigate to your contacts and call back using the saved number.
3. Scratch a random circle on your card.
4. Tell the caller which circle to scratch on their copy.
5. Wait for the caller to read the code firstâ€”never say it out loud.
6. If the codes match, you can be confident you're speaking with the right person.

Notify your network whenever a code is used. If your card is lost or compromised, tell the network so new cards can be issued.
