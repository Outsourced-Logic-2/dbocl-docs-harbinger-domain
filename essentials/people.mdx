## Managing Your Event Team

The People page is your command center for everyone involved in your event. Whether you're coordinating a 5-person team or managing a 500-person production, this centralized hub helps you track contacts, manage relationships, and ensure everyone has the information they need.

### What the People Page Does

Think of the People page as your intelligent address book with superpowers. It goes far beyond simple contact storage—it's designed to handle the complex relationships and detailed requirements that make events successful.

The page serves several key purposes:

- **Personnel Management:** Keep track of everyone from core team members to performers, vendors, and guests
- **Communication Hub:** Store contacts, preferences, and detailed notes about each person
- **Workflow Tracking:** Monitor who's confirmed, pending, or invited using the status system
- **Relationship Mapping:** Understand connections between people (who's whose manager, assistant, or emergency contact)
- **Integration Point:** Connect people to tasks, schedule items, and files throughout the platform

### Getting to the People Page

You can access the People page two ways:

- Click the People node from your main event dashboard
- Use the People tab in the left sidebar for direct access from anywhere

### How the Page Works

#### The Main Interface

When you open the People page, you'll see all your event participants displayed in one of two views:
- **Grid View** shows each person as an individual card with their photo, name, role, and key details. This visual approach makes it easy to browse and quickly identify people.
- **List View** displays everyone in a spreadsheet-like table with sortable columns. This view is better for administrative tasks and when you need to see lots of information at once.

#### Finding People Fast

The top of the page features powerful search and filtering tools:
- **Search Bar:** Start typing and watch the list filter in real-time. Search by name, role, department, tags, or even email addresses.
- **Filters:** Click the filter button to narrow down by department, status (like "Confirmed" or "Pending"), or custom tags. You can combine multiple filters to find exactly who you're looking for.
- **Sorting:** Organize the list alphabetically, by status, department, or when someone was last updated.

### Adding and Managing People

#### Creating New People

Click the "+ Add Person" button to open the person creation dialog. You'll fill in two main sections:
- **Basic Information:** This includes their name (and nickname if they prefer one), contact details, pronouns, timezone, and location. The platform is flexible—you only need to fill in what's relevant.
- **Organizational Details:** Set their role, department, and current status. You can also immediately assign them to tasks or add notes about their availability.

#### Understanding Person Profiles

Each person gets a comprehensive profile with four specialized tabs:
- **Relations Tab:** Map the connections between people. Who's whose manager? Which performer has which assistant? Understanding these relationships helps with communication flow and ensures you contact the right person.
- **Preferences Tab:** This is where the platform really shines. Store detailed travel preferences (aisle seat, no red-eyes), dietary requirements, lodging needs, accessibility requirements, and any custom preferences unique to your event type.
- **Notes Tab:** Keep a running timeline of communications, reminders, and important details. Notes include timestamps and authors, so your whole team stays informed. You can tag notes as private, team-visible, or admin-only.
- **Visibility Settings Tab:** Control who can see and edit each person's information, perfect for managing sensitive data or guest privacy.

### The Smart Status System

One of the most powerful features is the status tracking system. Each person moves through stages:

- **Invited:** You've reached out but haven't heard back
- **Pending:** They're interested but working out details
- **Confirmed:** Locked in and ready to go
- **Passed:** Decided not to participate (but kept for records)
- **Canceled:** Was confirmed but had to cancel
- **Removed:** No longer involved but archived for history

Status changes are automatically logged with timestamps and who made the change. This creates an audit trail and helps teams understand how participation evolved.

### Organizing with Tags

Tags are your flexible organization tool. Create color-coded tags like "Performer," "VIP," "First Timer," or "Special Dietary Needs." You can assign multiple tags to each person and then filter the entire list based on these tags. This makes it easy to send targeted communications or create specific reports.

### How It Connects to Everything Else

The People page doesn't work in isolation—it's deeply integrated with the rest of the platform:
- **Tasks:** Assign people to tasks directly from their profile. See all of someone's responsibilities at a glance.
- **Schedule:** Attach people to schedule items. Their calendar automatically updates, and you can see potential conflicts.
- **Files:** Share documents with specific people or attach files to their profiles for easy reference.
- **Travel:** Link to their travel arrangements and see their complete journey.

When you mention someone in a note or comment anywhere in the platform, it creates a two-way connection so you can always trace references.

### Working with Teams

The People page supports different permission levels to protect privacy while enabling collaboration:
- **Admins** get full access to create, edit, and manage anyone's profile, including sensitive information.
- **Managers** can edit people in their department and access relevant details for their area of responsibility.
- **Contributors** can add new people and edit profiles they create, but have limited access to sensitive data.
- **Viewers** can see public information and add notes but can't modify profiles.

### Import and Export

For large events, you don't have to enter everyone manually. Upload a CSV file with names, roles, and basic information to bulk-import people. The system provides a template and guides you through mapping your data to the right fields.

When you need to share information, export filtered lists to CSV or PDF. You can choose exactly which fields to include and whether to anonymize sensitive data for external sharing.

### Best Practices for Success

- **Keep Information Current:** Regularly update statuses and contact information. Out-of-date information can derail event logistics.
- **Use Consistent Naming:** Establish conventions for roles and departments so everyone on your team uses the same terminology.
- **Leverage Relationships:** Take time to map out who reports to whom and who's connected to whom. This prevents communication breakdowns and helps with emergency situations.
- **Document Everything:** Use the notes system liberally. That conversation about special requirements or timing constraints might be crucial weeks later.
- **Regular Reviews:** Schedule periodic reviews of your people list, especially for status updates and to clean up outdated tags.

The People page transforms what could be a chaotic spreadsheet of contacts into an intelligent, connected system that grows with your event needs and helps ensure no one falls through the cracks.
