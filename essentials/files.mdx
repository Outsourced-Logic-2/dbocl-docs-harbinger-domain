## Files Page Documentation

### Your Event's Digital Repository

The Files page is your event's central document library, designed to store, organize, and share every piece of digital content your event needs. From contracts and technical riders to photos and creative assets, it transforms what could be a chaotic collection of scattered documents into an intelligent, searchable, and collaborative workspace.

### What the Files Page Does

Think of the Files page as your event's memory bank. It doesn't just store documents—it connects them to the people, schedules, and tasks they relate to, creating a web of context that makes finding and using information effortless.

The page serves several critical functions:

- **Centralized Storage:** One place for all event-related documents and media
- **Intelligent Organization:** Tag-based system that allows multiple categorization methods
- **Version Control:** Track changes and maintain document history
- **Collaborative Workspace:** Team members can comment, review, and work together on files
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** Connect files to specific people, schedule items, and tasks
- **Access Control:** Manage who can see, edit, or share different types of content

### Understanding File Organization

#### The Tag-Based System

Traditional folder structures force you to choose one place for each file. The Files page uses a flexible tag system instead. A single file can have multiple tags—your venue contract might be tagged as "Contracts," "Venue," and "Legal" simultaneously. This means you can find it whether you're looking for all contracts, venue-related documents, or legal paperwork.

- **Creating Tags:** Tags are created on-the-fly as you need them. Color-code them for visual organization—red for urgent, blue for technical, green for completed. Establish tag conventions with your team to maintain consistency.
- **Virtual Folders:** While tags replace traditional folders, you can simulate folder structures by using consistent tag combinations. For example, use "Contracts-Vendor" and "Contracts-Talent" to create contract subcategories.

#### View Modes

- **Grid View** emphasizes visual identification with large thumbnails for images and recognizable icons for documents. This view excels when you're browsing for specific files or working with visual assets like photos and graphics.
- **List View** provides detailed information in a sortable table format. See file names, upload dates, uploaders, tags, and usage counts at a glance. This view is ideal for administrative tasks and when you need to process many files at once.

### Working with Files

#### Upload and Initial Setup

Adding files is straightforward—drag and drop from your computer, use the file selector, or bulk upload entire directories. The system supports everything from documents (PDF, Word, Excel) and media files (images, videos, audio) to specialized formats like design files and compressed archives.

- **Smart Metadata Entry:** While uploading, you can immediately add descriptions, tags, and connect files to people or schedule items. This front-loaded organization saves time later and ensures files enter the system with proper context.
- **Duplicate Detection:** The system flags files with identical names or content, preventing accidental duplicates that can cause confusion later.

#### File Details and Context

Click any file to see its complete profile. Beyond basic information like size and upload date, you'll see where the file is referenced throughout the platform—which schedule items include it, which people have it attached to their profiles, or which tasks reference it.

- **Preview Capabilities:** View PDFs directly in the browser, see image previews, and play media files without downloading. This immediate access speeds up workflows and reduces the need to juggle multiple applications.
- **Comment Threads:** Every file has its own discussion thread where team members can collaborate. Leave feedback on designs, ask questions about contracts, or coordinate reviews. @mentions ensure the right people see important messages.

#### Version Control

When you need to update a file, upload a new version rather than creating a separate file. The system maintains complete version history—see who uploaded each version, when, and any notes about what changed. You can revert to previous versions instantly if needed.

This is particularly valuable for documents that go through multiple revisions, like scripts, technical plans, or vendor agreements. Everyone always knows they're working with the latest version, but previous versions remain accessible for reference.

### Finding What You Need

#### Powerful Search

The search system looks beyond just filenames. Find files by description text, tag names, who uploaded them, or even who they're connected to. Search for "stage plot" and find not just files with those words in the name, but also files tagged with staging information or attached to schedule items about stage setup.

#### Advanced Filtering

Combine multiple filters to narrow down exactly what you're looking for. Filter by file type, upload date, tags, or who has access. The AND/OR logic lets you create complex queries like "show me all PDFs from this month that are tagged 'Technical' OR 'Vendor' AND have been shared with the lighting team."

- **Saved Filter Views:** Create and save frequently used filter combinations. Set up views like "Today's Call Sheets," "Pending Contracts," or "Technical Drawings" for instant access to relevant file sets.

### Integration and Connections

#### Cross-Platform Linking

Files don't exist in isolation—they connect meaningfully to the rest of your event. Attach contracts to vendor profiles, link technical riders to schedule items, or connect reference photos to tasks. These connections work both ways, so viewing a person's profile shows all their related files, and viewing a file shows everywhere it's referenced.

- **Smart References:** When you mention a file in comments or notes elsewhere in the platform, the system automatically creates these connections and tracks them.

#### Team Collaboration

- **File Assignments:** Assign files to specific team members for review, action, or reference. This creates accountability and ensures important documents don't get overlooked.
- **Access Tracking:** See who has viewed or downloaded files, useful for ensuring critical information has reached the right people.

### Security and Access Control

#### Permission Levels

Not all files need the same level of access. Set permissions per file:

- **Public within event:** Available to all team members
- **Department specific:** Limited to relevant teams
- **Admin only:** Sensitive documents like contracts or financial information
- **Private:** Visible only to uploader and designated individuals

#### Sensitive File Protection

Mark files as "sensitive" for extra protection. These files require elevated permissions to access and leave audit trails showing who viewed them when. Perfect for handling contracts, personal information, or confidential business documents.

- **Role-Based Access:** Your platform role determines your default file permissions. Admins get full access, managers can upload and organize within their areas, contributors can upload but have limited editing rights, and viewers can access non-private files but can't modify anything.

### Import and Export

#### Bringing Files In

Beyond direct uploads, import files from cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive. The system attempts to preserve metadata and organization from these sources.

- **Bulk Import:** Upload entire directory structures while maintaining organization through automatic tagging based on folder names.

#### Getting Files Out

- **Selective Export:** Export files individually or in bulk as ZIP archives. Choose whether to include metadata, comments, and usage references in the export.
- **Report Integration:** Files can be included in generated reports with previews, links, or full embedding depending on the report type and purpose.

### Best Practices for Success

- **Front-Load Organization:** Take time to properly tag and describe files when uploading. This small investment saves significant time later when searching and organizing.
- **Establish Naming Conventions:** Develop consistent naming patterns for different file types. Include dates, version numbers, and descriptive elements that make files identifiable at a glance.
- **Regular Cleanup:** Periodically review unused files, update tags, and archive outdated content. A lean, well-organized file system is easier to navigate and faster to search.
- **Use Descriptions Wisely:** The description field is searchable, so include keywords and context that might not be obvious from the filename. Explain what the file contains and why it's important.
- **Connect Everything:** Take advantage of the integration features. Link files to the people, schedule items, and tasks they relate to. These connections become invaluable for understanding context and finding related information.
- **Version Control Discipline:** When updating files, always use the version control feature rather than uploading separate files. This prevents confusion and ensures everyone is working with current information.
- **Monitor Access:** Use the access tracking features to ensure critical files reach the right people. If someone hasn't accessed an important document, you can follow up directly.

The Files page transforms document management from a necessary evil into a strategic advantage. By connecting your files to the broader context of your event and making them easily discoverable, you ensure that the right information reaches the right people at the right time, contributing to smoother operations and more successful events.
