## Task Page Documentation

### Getting Things Done Together

The Task page transforms your event's to-do list from a chaotic collection of sticky notes and scattered reminders into a coordinated, collaborative workspace. It's designed to help teams manage everything from small action items to complex multi-stage projects, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks and everyone knows what needs to happen when.

### What the Task Page Does

Think of the Task page as your event's accountability system. It doesn't just track what needs to be done—it organizes work into logical groups, manages dependencies between tasks, and keeps everyone informed about progress and deadlines.

The page serves several essential functions:

- **Project Management:** Break large event preparations into manageable, trackable tasks
- **Team Coordination:** Assign work to specific people and track their progress
- **Deadline Management:** Set due dates and monitor what's at risk of falling behind
- **Milestone Organization:** Group related tasks into larger project phases
- **Collaboration Hub:** Discuss task details, share files, and coordinate work in context
- **Dependency Tracking:** Ensure tasks happen in the right order

### Understanding Task Organization

#### View Modes for Different Needs

The Task page adapts to how you prefer to work and what you need to accomplish:
- **Flat List View** shows all tasks in a straightforward chronological list, perfect for daily planning and quick status updates. You can see everything at once and easily identify what's due today or overdue.
- **Milestone Grouped View** organizes tasks under collapsible project phases like "Pre-Production," "Event Day," and "Post-Event Wrap." This view helps you understand the bigger picture and see how individual tasks contribute to larger goals.

#### Smart Filtering for Focus

The filter system helps you focus on what matters right now. Filter by due date to see what's urgent, by assigned person to check someone's workload, or by tags to focus on specific types of work. Combine filters to create views like "John's overdue technical tasks" or "All client-facing items due this week."

- **Saved Views:** Create custom filter combinations for different purposes. Set up views for daily standup meetings, weekly planning sessions, or department-specific work.

### Creating and Managing Tasks

#### Building Comprehensive Tasks

When you create a task, you're not just writing a to-do item—you're building a complete work package. Start with a clear, action-oriented title that tells someone exactly what needs to happen.

- **Rich Descriptions:** Use the description area to provide context, requirements, and any details someone needs to complete the work. Include links to relevant information, specifications, or examples.
- **Smart Assignments:** Assign tasks to one or more people, with optional notes about each person's role. This clarity prevents confusion about who's responsible for what.
- **Due Dates with Purpose:** Set realistic due dates that account for dependencies and workload. The system shows countdown timers and flags overdue items to help maintain momentum.

#### Subtasks for Complex Work

Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces using subtasks. Each subtask can have its own assignee and completion status, letting you track progress on complex multi-step work while maintaining the overall task context.

- **Progress Visualization:** See completion percentages as subtasks are finished, giving you and your team a clear sense of progress on larger projects.

### Task Status Flow

Tasks move through a logical progression:

- **Open:** Ready to start
- **In Progress:** Actively being worked on
- **Complete:** Finished and verified
- **Blocked:** Waiting on something else

The Overdue status is automatically applied when due dates pass, helping identify what needs immediate attention.

### Milestone Management

#### Organizing Work by Phases

Milestones help organize tasks into meaningful groups that represent stages of your event. Create milestones for logical phases like "Venue Selection," "Marketing Launch," or "Load-In Day."

- **Milestone Independence:** Milestones can be completed independently of their tasks, useful for marking phase completion even if some administrative tasks remain.
- **Flexible Task Assignment:** Move tasks between milestones as plans evolve. This flexibility helps adapt to changing priorities without losing organizational structure.

#### Timeline Visualization

While primarily focused on task completion, milestones can include start and end dates to provide timeline context. This helps teams understand not just what needs to be done, but when different phases should happen.

### Collaboration and Communication

#### Task-Centered Discussions

Each task includes its own comment thread where assigned people and stakeholders can discuss details, ask questions, and provide updates. This keeps all task-related communication in one place, making it easy to understand context and decisions.

- **@Mentions and Notifications:** Tag team members in comments to bring them into the conversation. The notification system ensures important messages don't get lost.
- **File Attachments:** Attach relevant documents, images, or references directly to tasks. Files appear both in the task and in the main Files page with automatic cross-referencing.

#### Real-Time Updates

When someone updates a task status, adds a comment, or modifies details, relevant team members receive notifications. This real-time coordination helps teams stay aligned without constant check-in meetings.

### Advanced Task Features

#### Dependencies and Relationships

Link tasks to show dependencies and relationships. Mark one task as "blocked by" another to ensure work happens in the correct sequence. The system tracks these relationships and can notify teams when blocking tasks are completed.

- **Cross-Milestone Dependencies:** Tasks can depend on items in other milestones, supporting complex workflows that span project phases.

#### Bulk Operations

Select multiple tasks to perform bulk operations like reassigning work, updating due dates, applying tags, or changing status. This saves significant time when managing large task lists or responding to schedule changes.

#### Priority Management

If enabled, assign priorities to tasks to help teams focus on what matters most. Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) can be used for filtering and sorting, ensuring urgent work gets appropriate attention.

### Integration with Other Modules

#### People and Workload

View someone's assigned tasks directly from their People profile. This integration helps managers understand workloads and identify when someone might be overcommitted or available for additional work.

#### Schedule Connections

Link tasks to specific schedule items to create operational dependencies. For example, ensure "Stage setup complete" before "Sound check begins" by connecting the completion task to the soundcheck schedule item.

#### File References

Attach files to tasks for context and resources. When files are referenced in multiple tasks, the system tracks these connections, making it easy to see how resources are being used across your event.

### Finding and Organizing Tasks

#### Powerful Search

Search across task titles, descriptions, comments, and tags to find specific work items. The search system understands context, so searching for "sound" might return tasks about sound equipment, soundproofing, or soundtrack preparation.

#### Tag Strategy

Use tags to create flexible organizational schemes. Tag tasks by type ("Creative," "Technical," "Administrative"), priority ("Urgent," "Nice-to-have"), or any other criteria that help your team organize work.

- **Consistent Tagging:** Establish tag conventions across your team to ensure consistent organization and effective filtering.

### Permissions and Visibility

#### Role-Based Access

Different team members have different levels of task access:

- **Admins** can create, edit, and delete any task
- **Managers** can modify tasks they create or are assigned to
- **Contributors** can create tasks and update their own assignments
- **Viewers** can see tasks but cannot make changes

#### Task Privacy

Mark tasks as private for internal planning or sensitive work. Private tasks are only visible to assignees and administrators, useful for managing confidential aspects of event planning.

### Import and Export

#### Bulk Task Creation

Import tasks from CSV files using a provided template. This feature is invaluable for large events where you might be adapting task lists from previous projects or working with standardized checklists.

- **Field Mapping:** The import wizard helps map your data to the correct fields, handling assignees, due dates, tags, and milestone associations.

#### Progress Reporting

Export task lists with current status, completion percentages, and assignee information to create progress reports for stakeholders or post-event analysis.

### Best Practices for Task Success

- **Write Clear, Actionable Titles:** Make task titles specific and action-oriented. "Update website" is vague; "Update website with final speaker lineup and session times" is actionable.
- **Right-Size Your Tasks:** Break large tasks into smaller pieces, but don't go so granular that you spend more time managing tasks than doing work. Aim for tasks that take 1-4 hours to complete.
- **Use Due Dates Strategically:** Set due dates that account for dependencies and realistic workloads. Build in buffer time for complex tasks that might encounter unexpected complications.
- **Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular task review sessions with your team. Use these to update statuses, adjust priorities, and identify blockers before they become critical.
- **Document Decisions:** Use task comments to record important decisions or changes in approach. This creates a valuable history for understanding how work evolved.
- **Connect Related Work:** Take advantage of the integration features. Link tasks to relevant schedule items, attach necessary files, and connect to responsible people.
- **Maintain Task Hygiene:** Archive or delete completed tasks periodically to keep your active task list focused and manageable. Completed tasks should move to a "done" state rather than cluttering active views.
- **Communication Over Tools:** Remember that task management tools support communication, but they don't replace it. Use the comment features actively and don't hesitate to have conversations about unclear or complex tasks.

The Task page transforms event planning from a collection of individual to-do lists into a coordinated team effort. By providing structure, visibility, and accountability, it helps ensure that all the details that make events successful are handled systematically and collaboratively. When everyone can see what needs to be done, who's doing it, and how it all fits together, events run more smoothly and teams work more effectively.
