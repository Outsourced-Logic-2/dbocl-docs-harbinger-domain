## Schedule Page Documentation

### Your Event Timeline Command Center

The Schedule page is where your event comes to life on a timeline. It's more than just a calendar—it's a dynamic coordination tool that manages every moment of your event, from pre-production meetings to post-event wrap-up. Whether you're planning a simple gathering or orchestrating a complex multi-day production, the Schedule page keeps everyone synchronized and informed.

### What the Schedule Page Does

Think of the Schedule page as your event's central nervous system. Every timeline, every call time, every critical moment flows through here. The page serves as both a planning tool during preparation and a real-time coordination center during execution.

Key functions include:

- **Timeline Management:** Create, organize, and adjust every scheduled moment
- **Real-Time Coordination:** Track what's happening now and what's coming next
- **Team Communication:** Share detailed itineraries and call times
- **Resource Planning:** See who needs to be where and when
- **Report Generation:** Create professional itineraries for distribution

### Understanding the Interface

#### View Modes

The Schedule page offers three ways to view your timeline, each optimized for different tasks:
- **Calendar View** displays your schedule like a traditional calendar but with event-specific features. Each scheduled item appears as a colored block showing the title, time, assigned people, and tags. You can drag items to reschedule them instantly, and hovering over any block reveals quick details without opening the full item.
- **List View** shows everything chronologically in a table format. This view excels for detailed planning because you can see exact times, locations, assigned people, and countdown timers all at once. It's particularly useful during event execution when you need to quickly scan upcoming items.
- The sidebar filters let you focus on specific aspects of your schedule. Filter by date ranges, tags, assigned team members, or show only call times. The search bar looks across titles, locations, tags, and notes to help you find specific items instantly.

### Creating Schedule Items

#### Building Your Timeline

Click "+ New Schedule Item" to open the scheduler. The form walks you through everything needed to create a comprehensive schedule entry:
- **Basic Information:** Start with a clear title that immediately tells people what's happening. Set your start and end times with full timezone support—crucial for events with remote participants or multiple locations.
- **Location Details:** Enter the address with geolocation support for automatic mapping. The location notes field is where you add crucial details like parking instructions, entrance information, or on-site contact numbers that people will need when they arrive.
- **Team Assignment:** Select who needs to be there. You can assign multiple people and add role-specific notes (like "Lead Tech" or "Backup Driver"). The system tracks everyone's schedules to help prevent conflicts.
- **Enhanced Features:** Mark items as "Call Times" for official team notifications. Add tags for organization and filtering. Use the rich text description area for detailed instructions, links, or any context the team needs.

### Smart Scheduling Features

- **Clone to Multiple Dates:** Need the same setup every day? Clone an item to multiple dates with customizable time offsets. Perfect for recurring rehearsals or daily sound checks.
- **File Attachments:** Attach location maps, scripts, technical riders, or any documents specific to that schedule item. Files are accessible from both the schedule and the main Files page.
- **Integration Hooks:** Link schedule items to tasks (like "Tech setup must be completed before soundcheck") and automatically connect related travel arrangements.

### Working with Schedule Items

#### Real-Time Information

Each schedule item in list view shows a live countdown timer, so everyone knows exactly how much time remains. When an item is overdue, the display changes color to alert the team.

- **Status Indicators:** Visual cues show the current state of each item—upcoming, in progress, completed, or overdue. This real-time feedback helps keep complex events on track.
- **Quick Actions:** Hover over any item to access immediate options like editing, duplicating, or adding notes without leaving the main view.

#### Collaboration Tools

- **Comment Threads:** Every schedule item has its own discussion thread where team members can coordinate, ask questions, or leave updates. Comments support @mentions to notify specific people and can include file attachments.
- **Change Tracking:** The system logs all modifications with timestamps and users, creating a complete audit trail of how your schedule evolved.

### Creating Professional Reports

#### The Mail Function

One of the Schedule page's most powerful features is report generation. Click the mail icon to create professional, distributable itineraries.

- **Flexible Content:** Choose exactly which schedule items to include based on tags, dates, or assigned people. Control the detail level—from simple time and title to full descriptions with contact information and attachments.
- **Custom Branding:** Add your event name, logo, and location information to create professional-looking documents that represent your event well.
- **Multiple Formats:** Export as PDF for printing and emailing, or generate shareable links for digital distribution. You can even email reports directly to selected recipients from within the platform.
- **Smart Filtering:** Create different reports for different audiences. Generate a detailed technical schedule for crew while creating a simplified version for clients or guests.

### Advanced Organization

#### Tagging and Filtering

Tags transform a simple schedule into a powerful organizational tool. Create tags like "Tech," "Talent," "Client-Facing," or "Setup" to categorize your items. The filter system supports both individual tags and combinations with AND/OR logic.

- **Saved Filter Views:** Create custom views like "Today's Call Times" or "Technical Setup Items" and switch between them instantly. Share useful filter combinations with your team for consistent viewing.

#### Import and Export

- **Calendar Integration:** Export your schedule as ICS files that work with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook. You can export the full schedule or filtered subsets, and choose whether to include all details or just basic information.
- **External Import:** Import existing calendars to jump-start your schedule creation. The system parses events and maps them to schedule items for your review and refinement.

#### Bulk Operations

- **Multi-Select Actions:** Select multiple schedule items to apply bulk changes like updating assigned people, adding tags, or adjusting times with offsets. This saves significant time when managing large, complex schedules.

### How Schedule Connects

#### Integration with Other Modules

- **People Integration:** When you assign someone to a schedule item, it appears on their personal profile. The system detects scheduling conflicts and can alert you when someone is double-booked.
- **Task Integration:** Link schedule items to tasks to create dependencies. For example, ensure "Stage setup" is completed before "Sound check" begins.
- **Travel Coordination:** Connect schedule items to travel arrangements. Link pickup times to flight arrivals or hotel departure times to ensure seamless coordination.
- **File Connections:** Attached files are accessible from both the schedule item and the main Files page, with cross-references showing where each document is used.

### During Event Execution

#### Live Coordination

The Schedule page becomes your mission control during the event. The list view with countdown timers helps you stay on top of what's happening now and what's coming next.

- **Mobile Accessibility:** The schedule works on phones and tablets, so your team can access current information wherever they are.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes made to the schedule instantly appear for everyone, crucial for handling last-minute adjustments during live events.

#### Status Management

Mark items as completed as they happen to track progress through your event. The system maintains a record of actual timing versus planned timing for post-event analysis.

### Permission and Access Control

- **Role-Based Viewing:** Different team members can have different levels of access. Admins can edit everything, managers can modify their areas of responsibility, and contributors might only see relevant portions of the schedule.
- **Private Items:** Mark certain schedule items as private for internal planning while keeping public items visible to the broader team or external collaborators.

### Best Practices for Success

- **Clear, Descriptive Titles:** Use titles that immediately convey what's happening. "Soundcheck" is good, "Soundcheck - Main Stage with full band" is better.
- **Comprehensive Location Information:** Include everything people need to find and access the location. Address, parking, entrance instructions, and on-site contact information prevent confusion and delays.
- **Build in Buffer Time:** Plan transitions between items with realistic travel and setup time. Your schedule will be more resilient to minor delays.
- **Use Tags Strategically:** Develop a consistent tagging system your whole team understands. This makes filtering and reporting much more effective.
- **Regular Reviews:** Especially during planning phases, review your schedule regularly with key team members to catch conflicts and identify missing items.
- **Document Changes:** Use the note system to explain why changes were made, especially during event execution. This helps everyone understand the reasoning and provides valuable information for post-event reviews.

The Schedule page turns complex event timing from a coordination nightmare into a manageable, transparent system that keeps everyone informed and aligned throughout your event's lifecycle.
