## Core features

Every successful event starts with four fundamental building blocks, and dBocl puts them all in one place. 

**People** - organize your entire team from headline talent to backstage crew, complete with contact details, preferences, and who reports to who. 

**Schedule** - build your timeline from load-in to load-out, with color-coded views that let you spot conflicts before they become problems. 

**Files** - store everything from technical riders to contracts in one searchable hub, whether they live in Google Drive, Dropbox, or your phone. 

**Tasks** - assign, track, and complete the thousand moving parts that make events happen, with clear deadlines and accountability. No more hunting through email chains or wondering if the sound engineer got that last-minute stage plot update. Four features. One platform. Zero chaos.

## Tested in the Real World

Over 15 years, we've refined dBocl alongside One Foot Productions on events for the NBA, NFL, MTV, VH1, BET, Tony Awards, and Tribeca Film Festival. We've seen every kind of production chaos you can imagineâ€”and probably a few you can't.
