# dBocl: Back-of-House Event Management Platform

*Database Organizing Chaotic Logistics*

## What is dBocl?

dBocl (pronounced "debacle" = dĭ-bä'kəl) is an all-in-one back-of-house event management platform designed for event producers, festival organizers, theatrical company managers, tour managers, and other event professionals. The platform addresses a critical gap in the event management industry by focusing specifically on back-of-house (BOH) production logistics and schedules, rather than front-of-house needs like attendee management, budgeting, and marketing.

As the name suggests (Database Organizing Chaotic Logistics), dBocl was created on the principle that "chaos is born out of disorder and confusion - disorder because we don't have simple organized systems, and confusion because we don't all have the information we need." The platform aims to organize your information and connect everyone to it, providing an elegant and simple way of event planning.

## Platform Development History

dBocl was developed over the past 15+ years in conjunction with One Foot Productions for use on live events with major organizations and events including:

- NBA
- NFL
- MTV
- VH1
- BET
- Tony Awards
- Tribeca Film Festival
- And many more prestigious productions

This extensive real-world testing and refinement in high-pressure production environments has resulted in a tool specifically tailored to the unique challenges faced by event professionals working on complex productions.

## Why dBocl?

Producing large events is a significant undertaking often described as "chaotic." While many solutions exist for front-of-house needs, dBocl was developed as an easy-to-use organizational tool to manage the extensive back-of-house details that challenge even the most experienced event professionals.

**GOAL:** Create technology to organize and automate the tasks that consume too much time, reduce human error, and eliminate headaches.

**EXPERIENCE:** A clean, simple, web-based application that allows you to work smart, not hard, to produce successful, chaos-free events.
