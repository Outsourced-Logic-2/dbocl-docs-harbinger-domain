## Core features

Every successful event starts with four fundamental building blocks, and dBocl puts them all in one place\! Whether you're producing a festival with thousands of attendees, a corporate conference for a few hundred people or a small community event, the same core challenges surface every time: keeping track of your team, building a bulletproof schedule, organizing mountains of documents, and managing the endless tasks that make events happen.

Most event professionals juggle these across a dozen different tools—spreadsheets for contacts, separate apps for scheduling, email chains for files, and sticky notes for tasks. The result? Critical information gets lost, team members work with outdated schedules, and producers spend more time hunting for details than actually producing. dBocl changes that equation entirely.
