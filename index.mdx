## What is the Human Verification Card?

The Human Verification Card is a small physical card covered with scratch‑off stickers. Under each sticker is a code that only you and your trusted contacts know. When you need to confirm a caller's identity, scratch a random circle and ask them to reveal the same code on their copy of the card.

## Why it Matters

Phone and online scams often rely on quickly gaining your trust. By forcing an attacker to supply a secret code they shouldn't know, the card provides a simple second factor that anyone can use—no apps or passwords required.
