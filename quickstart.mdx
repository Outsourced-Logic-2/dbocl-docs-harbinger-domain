## Step 1: Prepare Your Cards

Apply the provided code stickers to the numbered circles on each blank card.

## Step 2: Seal the Codes

Cover every code with a scratch-off security sticker to keep it hidden until it's needed.

## Step 3: Make Identical Copies

Repeat the process to create multiple cards that all share the same secret codes.

## Step 4: Distribute to Your Network

Give a copy to each person you frequently share sensitive information withâ€”family, friends, or business partners. Keep networks separate if they don't overlap.

## Step 5: Verify When Needed

When you receive a suspicious call or message, hang up and call back using the number saved in your contacts. Both parties scratch the same random circle. If the codes match, you're likely talking to the right person.
