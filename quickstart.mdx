## Step 1: Create Your Event

Start with the basics - event name, dates, and location. This becomes your central hub where everything else connects. Think of it as setting up your production office, except it's instantly accessible to your entire team from anywhere.

## Step 2: Add Your People

Import your contacts or build your team from scratch. Organize everyone by role - talent, crew, vendors, management. Each person gets their own profile with contact details, preferences, and permissions. No more digging through business cards or scrolling through endless phone contacts.

## Step 3: Build Your Schedule

Create your timeline from load-in to wrap. Add time blocks, tag them by department, and break complex moments into detailed rundowns. The color-coded calendar view instantly shows you what's happening when - and more importantly, where conflicts might be lurking.

## Step 4: Connect People to Schedule

Link team members to specific schedule items. Who needs to be where, when? dBocl automatically creates personalized schedules for each person, so your lighting designer only sees their calls, while you maintain the master view of everything.

## Step 5: Add Travel & Share

Book flights, hotels, and ground transport directly in the platform. Generate comprehensive itineraries that include both travel and schedule details. Export custom reports for different audiences - detailed technical schedules for crew, simplified call sheets for talent.

**The result?** Your entire production in one organized system. No more "Did you get my email?" or "Which version of the schedule are we using?" Just clarity, coordination, and successful events.
